PHP Scripts
===========

- Install PHP on the Emby server computer (Windows simply place in a directory for eg c:\php), - with Windows add the path to the PHP folder in your environment variable.

- In the 'Script' field include the entire path to your PHP script, eg d:\myscripts\playback.php

- In the 'Interpreter' field specify the path to the PHP binary - eg, Windows, c:\php\php.exe (you may only need to use 'php' if your environment variables are setup correctly.

- In the parameters field, check out the top comment in the example script you wish to test/use, it will show what parameters it expects and where (for testing)
