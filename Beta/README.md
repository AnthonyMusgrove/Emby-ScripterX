Beta Releases
-------------

Version 5.0.0.0+ 
------------------------
This version is intended for Emby Server 4.8.*+ (BETA CHANNEL).  This will not work on previous 4.7 server release versions.  This DLL will be updated as time permits.  The official Emby Plugin Catalog is still our official point of release for both RELEASE & BETA streams.  We're just in the process of reconnecting with the Emby Dev Team to provide our next BETA release (this release) to the Live catalog.

To test this DLL, you'll need to download it and copy it to your Emby Server's 'plugins' directory, for example in Windows it is located at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Emby-Server\programdata\plugins, and is located in various locations in linux, unix and other OS.


OLD RELEASE (4.0.0.0+) for Emby Server 4.7 Beta
-----------------------------------------------
Note:  version 4.0.0.0 is intended for Emby Server 4.7.0.35 (BETA)  -- This may not function correctly (AT ALL) on mainstream release.

Many changes have been made to the internal functionality of Emby LiveTV, and ScripterX needed to be adjusted to utilise the new infrastructure.

This requires TESTING -- Please submit Issues under BETA of this Github Repo so that we can track and rectify before it becomes live.

Thank you!
