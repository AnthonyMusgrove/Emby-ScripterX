Community Scripts Directory
===========================

If you have a script that you feel would be useful to the Emby ScripterX community, please feel free to send me a private message with your script and a description of what it does and I'll be more than happy to showcase it here.   Eventually the Plugin will be able to read this directory and allow the Emby-ScripterX user to download premade scripts based on what they would like to acheive, all from the Emby GUI.
